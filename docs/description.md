Adds a small indicator to Anki's toolbar, displaying the number of people currently known to have recovered from [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic) / the current coronavirus pandemic.

**Requires Anki 2.1.22 or higher to work correctly** (which was [just released today](https://apps.ankiweb.net/#download))

### FAQ

**Why?**

It is important that we all do our part to fight this disease and [flatten the curve](https://www.flattenthecurve.com/). However, in this time of quarantine, social distancing, and all around worry, it's easy to get discouraged. My hope is that this add-on will provide some light at the end of tunnel, reminding us that this situation too shall pass.

**Where is the data sourced from?**

All data displayed by the add-on is sourced from the [Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) via a [third-party API](https://github.com/mathdroid/covid-19-api). Please note that the API is updated slightly less frequently than the site, so the data shown within Anki sometimes lags behind by a bit. The data also does not account for recoveries that were not confirmed / followed up on, which means that the actual recovery count is likely quite a bit higher.
